# Improvements

- Support `-p` / `--prefix` flag in the `files` collector
- Update help for the `netstat` collector to be more helpful
- The `linux` collector now has a new pair of arguments,
  `--include` and `--exclude` for matching things inclusively, or
  excluding them altogether
- The `nagwrap` collector now more deftly supports unresponsive or
  timed-out check plugin runs
- Refactor SNMP collectors to be more robust

# Bug Fixes

- Transmit RATE metrics as unsigned long integers, instead of
  floating-point decimals
- Fix formatting bug that resulted in a loss of KEY data submitted
  from the Perl Bolo::Collector framework and the `linux` collector
- Set the user-agent in the `httpd` collector to "httpd" (not
  "nginx"), so that Apache use cases make sense
- Fix mislabeled diskio metrics in `linux` collector
